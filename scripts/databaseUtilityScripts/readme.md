# Database utility scripts

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to gather various database utility scripts for Azure SQL database.

## Background

Many of the scripts in mssql are complex and non-intuitive, and simple things like checking permissions and roles can require lots googling, testing and adjustments to achieve a decent script. Instead of inventing the wheel several times, I propose these scripts can be added to ioc-shared-infrastructure for safekeeping for current and future employees. This will also allow developers to collaborate on further refining the scripts.
